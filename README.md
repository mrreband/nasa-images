# Nasa Images

## Scripts for NASA Feeds

NASA has two independent feeds that each publish a new image once a day:

- [Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/)
- [Image of the Day (IOTD)](https://www.nasa.gov/image-of-the-day/)

The scripts in this repo fetch and download images from each feed, with options to ...

- automatically open in your default image preview app
- automatically set as desktop wallpaper

---

- [python version](./python/README.md)
- [powershell version](./powershell/README.md)
